# Uber Demand Supply Gap Analysis

The project is based on the gap between supply demand on specific time slots in Bengaluru.

For on-demand companies like **Uber**, that is primarily a three-sided marketplace, matching demand and supply is at the core of the business and also extremely challenging.

When supply-demand gaps comes into the picture, such companies either loses orders or the riders are idle â€” both of which contributes to money loss.
## Roadmap

- Importing Python Libraries

- Data Collection & Analysis

- Data Cleaning

- Data Featuring

- Data Visualization & Plotting of Graphs

- Exporting Final Data


## Problem Statement

Certain pain points had occured which is majorly **impacting** the Uber's Business.

Some of the issues are :

- Rides going from City to Airport getting cancelled is higher than regular trips.

- Trips from Airport to City during specific timeslot(early morning) is not economically beneficial to the drivers.

- As a result of the high variance of the time of arrivals of the flights, the driver idle time is higher than expected.

## Tech Stack

**Tools:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn


## Summary

It is observed that during evening hours, 73% of the total airport rides ended with no cars available

For airport to city rides, gap of demand-supply is highest in evening hours.

For city to airport rides, gap of demand-supply is highest in early morning hours.
